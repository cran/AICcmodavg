Compute Summary Statistics from Time to Detection Data
}
\description{
This function extracts various summary statistics from time to detection
data of various \code{unmarkedFrame} and \code{unmarkedFit} classes.
}
\usage{
detTime(object, plot.time = TRUE, plot.seasons = FALSE, \dots)

\method{detTime}{unmarkedFrameOccuTTD}(object, plot.time = TRUE,
                   plot.seasons = FALSE, \dots)

\method{detTime}{unmarkedFitOccuTTD}(object, plot.time = TRUE,
                   plot.seasons = FALSE, \dots)
}

\arguments{
  \item{object}{
    an object of various \code{unmarkedFrame} or \code{unmarkedFit}
    classes containing time to detection data. 
  }
 \item{plot.time}{
   logical.  Specifies if the time to detection data (pooled across
   seasons) should  be plotted.
 }
 \item{plot.seasons}{
   logical.  Specifies if the time to detection data should be plotted
   for each season separately.  This argument is only relevant
   for data collected across more than a single season.
 }
 
  \item{\dots}{
    additional arguments passed to the function.
  }
}

\details{
  This function computes a number of summary statistics in data sets
  used for the time to detection models of Garrard et al. (2008,
  2013).
  
  \code{detTime} can take data frames of the \code{unmarkedFrameOccuTTD}
  class as input, or can also extract the raw data from model objects of
  the \code{unmarkedFitOccuTTD} class.  Note that different model
  objects using the same data set will have identical values.
}
\value{
  \code{detTime} returns a list with the following components:
  
  \item{time.table.full}{a table with the quantiles of time to
    detection data pooled across seasons, but excluding censored
    observations.}
  
  \item{time.table.seasons}{a list of tables with the quantiles of
    season-specific time to detection data, but excluding censored
    observations.}

  \item{out.freqs}{a matrix where the rows correspond to each sampling
    season and where columns consist of the number of sites sampled in
    season \eqn{t} (\code{sampled}) and the number of sites with at
    least one detection in season \eqn{t} (\code{detected}).  For
    multiseason data, the matrix includes the number of sites sampled in
    season \eqn{t - 1} with colonizations observed in season \eqn{t}
    (\code{colonized}), the number of sites sampled in season \eqn{t -
    1} with extinctions observed in season \eqn{t} (\code{extinct}), the
    number of sites sampled in season \eqn{t - 1} without changes
    observed in season \eqn{t} (\code{static}), and the number of sites
    sampled in season \eqn{t} that were also sampled in season \eqn{t -
    1} (\code{common}).
  }

  \item{out.props}{a matrix where the rows correspond to each sampling
    season and where columns consist of the proportion of sites in
    season \emph{t} with at least one detection (\code{naive.occ}).  For
    multiseason data, the matrix includes the proportion of sites
    sampled in season \eqn{t - 1} with colonizations observed in season
    \eqn{t} (\code{naive.colonization}), the proportion of sites
    sampled in season \eqn{t - 1} with extinctions observed in season
    \eqn{t} (\code{naive.extinction}), and the proportion of sites
    sampled in season \eqn{t - 1} with no changes observed in season
    \eqn{t}.
  }

  \item{n.seasons}{the number of seasons (primary periods) in the data
  set.
  }

  \item{n.visits.season}{the maximum number of visits per season in the
  data set.
  }
