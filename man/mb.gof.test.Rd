\details{
MacKenzie and Bailey (2004) and MacKenzie et al. (2006) suggest using
the Pearson chi-square to assess the fit of single season occupancy
models (MacKenzie et al. 2002).  Given low expected frequencies, the
chi-square statistic will deviate from the theoretical distribution and
it is recommended to use a parametric bootstrap approach to obtain
P-values with the \code{parboot} function of the \code{unmarked}
package.  \code{mb.chisq} computes the table of observed and expected
values based on the detection histories and single season occupancy
model used. \code{mb.gof.test} calls internally \code{mb.chisq} and
\code{parboot} to generate simulated data sets based on the model and
compute the MacKenzie and Bailey test statistic.  Missing values are
accomodated by creating cohorts for each pattern of missing values.

It is also possible to obtain an estimate of the overdispersion
parameter (c-hat) for the model at hand by dividing the observed
chi-square statistic by the mean of the statistics obtained from
simulation. 

This test is extended to dynamic occupancy models of MacKenzie et
al. (2003) by using the occupancy estimates for each season obtained
from the model.  These estimates are then used to compute the predicted
and observed frequencies separately within each season.  The chi-squares
are then summed to be used as the test statistic for the dynamic
occupancy model.

Note that values of c-hat > 1 indicate overdispersion (variance > mean),
but that values much higher than 1 (i.e., > 4) probably indicate
lack-of-fit.  In cases of moderate overdispersion, one usually
multiplies the variance-covariance matrix of the estimates by c-hat.  As
a result, the SE's of the estimates are inflated (c-hat is also known as
a variance inflation factor). 

In model selection, c-hat should be estimated from the global model and
the same value of c-hat applied to the entire model set.  Specifically,
a global model is the most complex model from which all the other models
of the set are simpler versions (nested).  When no single global model
exists in the set of models considered, such as when sample size does
not allow a complex model, one can estimate c-hat from 'subglobal'
models.  Here, 'subglobal' models denote models from which only a subset
of the models of the candidate set can be derived.  In such cases, one
can use the smallest value of c-hat for model selection (Burnham and
Anderson 2002).

Note that c-hat counts as an additional parameter estimated and should
be added to K.  All functions in package \code{AICcmodavg} automatically
add 1 when the \code{c.hat} argument > 1 and apply the same value of
c-hat for the entire model set.  When c-hat > 1, functions compute
quasi-likelihood information criteria (either QAICc or QAIC, depending
on the value of the \code{second.ord} argument) by scaling the
log-likelihood of the model by c-hat.  The value of c-hat can influence
the ranking of the models:  as c-hat increases, QAIC or QAICc will favor
models with fewer parameters.  As an additional check against this
potential problem, one can generate several model selection tables by
incrementing values of c-hat to assess the model selection uncertainty.
If ranking changes little up to the c-hat value observed, one can be
confident in making inference.

In cases of underdispersion (c-hat < 1), it is recommended to keep the
value of c-hat to 1.  However, note that values of c-hat << 1 can also
indicate lack-of-fit and that an alternative model should be investigated.

\value{
  \code{mb.chisq} returns the following components for single-season and
  Royle-Nichols occupancy models:
  
  \item{chisq.table}{the table of observed and expected values for each
    detection history and its chi-square component (if \code{print.table
    = TRUE}).  Note that the table only shows the observed detection
    histories.  Unobserved detection histories are not shown, but are
    included in the computation of the test statistic.
  }
  \item{chi.square}{the Pearson chi-square statistic.  This test
    statistic should be compared against a bootstrap distribution
    instead of the theoretical chi-square distribution because low
    expected frequencies invalidate the chi-square assumption.
  }
  \item{model.type}{the model type, either \code{single-season},
    \code{royle-nichols}, or \code{dynamic}. 
  }

  \code{mb.chisq} returns the following additional components for dynamic
  occupancy models:
  
  \item{tables}{a list containing the season-specific chi-square tables
    (if \code{print.table = TRUE}).
  }
  \item{all.chisq}{an element containing the season-specific chi-squares.
  }
  \item{n.seasons}{the number of primary periods (seasons).
  }


  \code{mb.gof.test} returns the following components for single-season
  and Royle-Nichols occupancy models:
  
  \item{chisq.table}{the table of observed and expected values for each
    detection history and its chi-square component.
  }
  \item{chi.square}{the Pearson chi-square statistic.
  }
  \item{t.star}{the bootstrapped chi-square test statistics (i.e.,
    obtained for each of the simulated data sets).
  }
  \item{p.value}{the P-value assessed from the parametric bootstrap,
    computed as the proportion of the simulated test statistics greater
    than or equal to the observed test statistic.
  }
  \item{c.hat.est}{the estimate of the overdispersion parameter, c-hat,
    computed as the observed test statistic divided by the mean of the
    simulated test statistics.
  }
  \item{nsim}{the number of bootstrap samples. The recommended number of
    samples varies with the data set, but should be on the order of 1000
    or 5000, and in cases with a large number of visits, even 10 000
    samples, namely to reduce the effect of unusually small values of the
    test statistics.
  }

  \code{mb.gof.test} returns the following additional components for
  dynamic occupancy models:

  \item{chisq.table}{a list including the table of observed and expected
    values for each detection history and its chi-square component for
    each primary period (season).
  }
  \item{chi.square}{the chi-square test statistic, as the sum of the 
    chi-squares across the primary periods.
  }
  \item{p.value}{a list of the P-values for each of the primary periods,
    computed separately as the proportion of the simulated test
    statistics greater than or equal to the observed test statistic.
  }
  \item{p.global}{the P-value of the chi-square test statistic for the
    dynamic occupancy model.  This P-value is computed as the proportion
    of the simulated sums of chi-squares greater than or equal to the
    observed sum of chi-squares across the primary periods.
